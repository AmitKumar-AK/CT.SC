# Creating and deploying custom Sitecore xConnect models

The purpose of this code base is to provide information about how to create/use Custom Sitecore xConnect Model in Sitecore implementation.

We have used the following articles for this:

- [Create a custom model](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/100/sitecore-experience-platform/create-a-custom-model.html) / [Walkthrough: Creating custom facets and events](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/100/sitecore-experience-platform/walkthrough--creating-custom-facets-and-events.html)

- [Deploy a custom model](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/100/sitecore-experience-platform/deploy-a-custom-model.html) / [Understand xConnect model deployment](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/101/developer-tools/including-a-custom-xconnect-model.html#understand-xconnect-model-deployment_body)

The following Visual Studio Solutions being used:
- [Serialize the custom xConnect model](../../ModelBuilder/code)
- [Sitecore xConnect Role](../../Website/code/)
- [Sitecore CM Role](../../../cm/Website/code)
- [Sitecore CD Role](../../../../Project/BrandA/code)
- [Use of Sitecore xConnect custom model](../../../../Feature/Accounts/code/)

> ### The above solutions should be used to deploy the required artifacts to specific Sitecore Roles as per [Understand xConnect model deployment](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/101/developer-tools/including-a-custom-xconnect-model.html#understand-xconnect-model-deployment_body)
